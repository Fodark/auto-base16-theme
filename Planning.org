* Left off
* To Do
** TODO Test selections with more images
** TODO Green and red tint for diff colors? Either way, establish relationship between those two (and maybe others) ensuring they are different
*** Relationships
**** base08, base0B, base0E should be unique between eachother (diff colors)
**** Always have base08 variables be darker than 0A classes, 0D functions, and 0E keywords?
**** Ensure no other foreground text values are the same as base03 comments?
** TODO Take template to use as a command line argument
** TODO Support different heuristic modes (e.g. light theme, more muted, more contrasty)
** TODO IMPORTANT Make sure things are contrasty relative to line highlight (base01?)
** TODO Figure out how to update base16 theme colors without having to reload emacs (just unset and set in customize-themes?)
*** TODO Emacs interface doesn't update correctly (status bars) without having to reload, which doesn't give an accurate picture for those colors
** TODO Post on /r/unixporn, pull request to add to readme of https://github.com/chriskempson/base16
* Done
** DONE Consider making a maximum contrast to avoid starkly bright text
*** Test maximum brightness code
** DONE Make sure base03 comments has a high enough contrast
** DONE Check contrast better (i.e. with some fancy algorithm)
** DONE Contrast ratio between text colors shouldn't be too great (try georgia.jpg for a bad result)
** DONE Make it so hawaii.jpg and georgia.jpg look good (don't let background get too colorful?)
*** blade2.jpg makes it seem like I need some background brightness clamping system
** DONE Fix blade1.jpg backgrounds getting clamped too hard
** DONE Fix DadSuper8Title not having some things show up (it was a duplicate color in the palette)
