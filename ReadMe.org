* Auto Base16 Theme
[[./images/Example4.jpg]]
** What it does
This script generates a [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][base16]] color theme intended for code syntax highlighting from a source image.

This means you can have *beautiful, readable* themes which match your desktop background without having to do any work.

I'm primarily focusing on doing this for Emacs, but it should work for any editor which supports base16.

** Setup
This script relies on [[https://github.com/thefryscorer/schemer2][schemer2]] to choose colors from images. It then takes the output of schemer2 and selects colors which fit the base16 format. Make sure you have Go installed, then install schemer2:
: go get github.com/thefryscorer/schemer2

Additionally, AutoBase16Theme.py requires Python 3.

** How to Use
Run the following command, replacing "your image" with the image you want the theme's colors to be pulled from:
: schemer2 -format img::colors -in [your image] -out colors.txt && python3 AutoBase16Theme.py
Automating the execution of this so that it updates with your desktop background is left as an exercise for the reader :).
